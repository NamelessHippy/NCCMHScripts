# NCCMHScripts
Scripts by NCCMH IT that are shared with external contacts

All of my scripts have verbose feedback for all actions being taken.  This is to keep the user informed of what step the script is on if they are not activly monitoring it as it runs.  It also make it so you are not looking at a blank screen when monitoring the script running.
